            There is nothing more human than the culinary experience. The sensations of texture and flavor elicit the primal response from which this ritual was derived. A response that now seems so distant from the civilized customs imposed onto it by ever evolving cultures. Still, it holds these fundamental qualities ingrained in our nature. Creation, consumption and community, three driving forces that will always be associated with the human experience. I find these habits ever intriguing in my life and in society at large. I am extremely grateful for the role that food as a means of cultural experience has played in my life. Shabbat dinners, food festivals, fine dining, drive throughs, just a few of the many culinary experiences that have shaped me. What was once a habit born of pure necessity, has now become a ubiquitous practice of great cultural significance.
